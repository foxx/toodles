# Toodles Web Framework

Toodles is a framework for building web APIs which are clean and scalable.

Toodles extends functionality from several other libraries, rather than implementing it's own.
These were chosen for their beauty, minimalism and track record of good maintainance.

* Peewee (ORM)
* Marshmallow (Schema)
* Bottle (WSGI)
* Jinja2 (Templating)

Toodles supports the following features out of the box;

* Class based views
* Content negotiation
* Access controls (TBD)
* Database management
* CLI
